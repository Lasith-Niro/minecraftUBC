Interested in helping build? Make sure you've joined the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FqbDJNPgDu) and then read through this document to get started.

## Useful Links
- [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FqbDJNPgDu)
- [Building Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16vR1eYbdkNVdfTgkR4nw5c2QBYRDDq_WJ4L-AfOAfrM/edit?usp=sharing)
  - If you're a builder, please request access to this spreadsheet so you can edit it.

## The Building Process
1. Put your name, discord name, and Minecraft name into the Builders sheet under the [Building Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16vR1eYbdkNVdfTgkR4nw5c2QBYRDDq_WJ4L-AfOAfrM/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Find the building(s) you want to build on the Building sheet, claim them (Discord name), and select "not started" for progress. 
3. Once you've claimed a building, please make sure you've read through the [WorldEdit Basics](#worldedit-basics) section of this document. This will help you get started with building.
4. When you're building, Google Maps and Google Earth are useful resources. See the [Matching with Google Maps and Google Earth](#matching-with-google-maps-and-google-earth) section of this document for more information.
5. Please update your progress as you go along on the spreadsheet. If you're not going to be able to finish a building, please unclaim it so someone else can work on it (leave progress as is).
6. Don't worry too much about detailing for now. We can do that later on. For now, focus on getting the basic patterns, windows, and some floors (if necessary) in place. If you're not sure what to do for detailing, please ask in the Discord server. We're happy to help.
7. If you know that the building has a basement, it's ok to leave the bottom of the building as void - This is so that we can add the basement later on. If you're not sure please leave it void just in case. Only fill it if it's necessary.
8. Leave the inside hollow, or just add the floors. No interior detailing is necessary at this point.
9. When you're done, please mark the progress as "finished" on the spreadsheet. 

Want to join another builder on a building? That's fine! Put your name in the "additional builders" column on the spreadsheet and check in with the other builder(s) for that building.



## WorldEdit Basics
WorldEdit will make your building life so much easier throughout this process. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOOvommDpUA) for a good tutorial. Most importantly, the tools I've used most often are:
- //set - This will set the blocks within your selection region to the block you specify. For example, `//set stone` will set all blocks in your selection region to stone.
- //replace - This will replace all blocks of a certain type with another type. For example, `//replace stone cobblestone` will replace all stone blocks with cobblestone blocks.
  - You can also use `//replace #existing stone` to replace all blocks that aren't air with stone.
- //copy - This will copy the blocks within your selection region to your clipboard.
  - Note that it copies relative to your position to the selection region (so when you paste later, it'll place the blocks around you relative to your position when you copied).
- //paste - This will paste the blocks in your clipboard to the location of your cursor.
- //rotate - This will rotate the blocks in your clipboard. For example, `//rotate 90` will rotate the blocks in your clipboard 90 degrees clockwise. Useful if one side of a building is the exact same as another side. 

## Matching with Google Maps and Google Earth
This process is straightforward. A few pointers:
- Google Earth's 3d data is old. It doesn't have the latest buildings. Same with some views of street view. As a result some buildings don't have all sides of them captured. 
- It's better to have floors slightly offset as long as you're able to gt the right amount of them there. Lots of the "blocks" in UBC don't align with meter chunks, and so some floors might have to be a block taller or a block shorter than the rest of them. That's okay within reason. (Ponderosa is a good example of the blocks not ligning up with meter chunks -- lots of estimation had to be done). Getting the exteriors accurate is the most important part.
