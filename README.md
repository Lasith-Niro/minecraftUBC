The UBC Minecraft Project is a project that aims to recreate the UBC Vancouver Campus inside a Minecraft world, in a 1:1 scale. The project is currently a collaboration between Ashtan Mistal and the UBC Electrical and Computer Engineering Student Society. 
The project will be hosted on a server that is accessible to all UBC students, and will be used as a platform for students to explore the campus, and a potential for event hosting once it is completed. The project will allow students new to UBC to explore the campus and get a feel for the campus before they arrive, and will allow students who are currently studying at UBC to explore the campus in a new way.
The project will be built in a 1:1 scale, meaning that 1 block in Minecraft will be equal to 1 meter in real life. This will allow students to explore the campus in a way that is as close to real life as possible.

The project works by manipulating LiDAR data (available [here](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/lidar-2022/information/)) into Minecaft blocks after a series of coordinate transformations and rotations. 

Read more about the project and its current progress in the [planning documentation](https://github.com/ashtanmistal/minecraftUBC/blob/master/planning/planning.md).
